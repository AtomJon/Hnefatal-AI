# Fetlar Hnefatafl
Rules for Fetlar Hnefatafl (slightly modified)
1. The game is played with a king and twelve defenders against 24 attackers. They start the game laid out as shown in the diagram.

2. The attackers move first.

3. All pieces move along a row or column any number of spaces.

4. A moving piece cannot land on another, nor may pieces jump.

5. No piece but the king can occupy the corner squares or the central square.

6. A piece is captured by surrounding it on two opposite sides along a row or column with two pieces of your own. The enemy is immediately removed from the board.

7. It is sometimes possible to capture two or three enemies separately (i.e. not two or three enemies in a row) against other pieces of your own in a single move; in this case all captured pieces are removed at once.

8. It is also possible to capture a piece against the corner squares, or the central square if it is empty, as if one of your pieces were sitting on it.

9. The king can only be captured by surrounding him on all four sides, or by surrounding him on 3 sides with while he's against a wall.

10. To win, the defenders must get the king to one of the four marked corner squares.
